**Statement of Contribution:** Our project supports good health and well-being by visualizing the relationship between air quality and respiratory illnesses across different communities. By integrating environmental, health, and socioeconomic data, we help uncover patterns that inform equitable public health responses and raise awareness of environmental health risks

## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth

From the individual InfoVis Redesign project, we became familiarized with the process of creating visualizations and its supporting resources like posters, reports, and creating a github. We shared our strengths and weaknesses from the project to give ourselves the best roles to create the best visualization for our final project. The in-class activities improved our understanding and gave practice for our visualization and gave ideas of inspiration for our final project. The final session with feedback was also very helpful. Group 2 told us the importance of color scheme and clarity and was something we kept in mind throughout our final process. The symposium improved our presentation skills and provided valuable feedback that we can take with us to our final project. From the Zhou Zhuang Mysterious Life Museum our group saw visualizations could be used in a real case and the importance visualizations have in the day to day and in academic fields.
