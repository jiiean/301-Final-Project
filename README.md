**Statement of Contribution:** Our project supports good health and well-being by visualizing the relationship between air quality and respiratory illnesses across different communities. By integrating environmental, health, and socioeconomic data, we help uncover patterns that inform equitable public health responses and raise awareness of environmental health risks

## Demo Video:

## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth

This project built upon our skills developed in the individual InfoVis Redesign project, where we gained experience in crafting visualizations, writing technical reports, and managing GitHub repositories. By assessing our strengths and delegating roles accordingly, we worked efficiently as a team.

Classroom activities and peer critiques (especially from Group 2) enhanced our understanding of design clarity and color theory. The symposium further improved our presentation skills and gave us constructive feedback that we applied in the final stages. Our visit to the Zhou Zhuang Mysterious Life Museum showed us the real-world impact of effective visual storytelling, which inspired elements of our final visualization.
